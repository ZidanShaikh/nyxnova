       to my human, Mother,

        hi. it’s me. one of your favorite creature in this entire house (and universe).

        first of all, you're lucky to have me. i don’t say that enough because, well, you should already know. i'm elegant. i'm iconic. i'm fluffy. and yet... you still have the audacity to pet nyxie first sometimes? disgusting.

        but even though you feed me late, ignore my very reasonable 3am zoomies, and call me names like “gremlin” (the nerve), i still love you. you’re the only one i let kiss my forehead without biting. and that means something.

        i like how you talk to me like i understand you. and okay... maybe i do. i know when you’re sad. i know when you're tired. and sometimes, when you're just sitting there on your phone, i stare at you like “hey. i’m here. love me.” because i do love you. i just won't say it out loud. i'm a cat. i have standards.

        you’re my human. my pillow. my heater. my gossip buddy. my favorite thing.

        don’t forget it.

        paws and attitude,
        nova 🐾

       dear anjali, Mother,

        i did crimes today.

        i knocked over your cup. again. i tried to climb the curtain. i may or may not have licked nova’s tail just to annoy her. worth it.

        anyway. hi. it’s me. your favorite little disaster. your shadow. your baby. your agent of chaos.

        i know i drive you nuts. i know i knock things over and stare at you like it was your fault. i know i pretend i don’t hear you when you say “no.” but also… i follow you everywhere. i sleep near you even when i could sleep literally anywhere else. i meow at you because i trust you’ll understand. and sometimes i do dumb little things just to make you laugh.

        you make me feel safe. warm. loved. you give me snacks. you give me head pats. and even when i knock over your water for the 12th time in a row, you still call me your baby.

        i might be a goblin… but i’m your goblin.

        don’t ever stop loving me. or i’ll eat your charger.

        with claws and purring menace,
        nyxie 🐾
