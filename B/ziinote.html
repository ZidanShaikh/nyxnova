      Hey Anjali,
        Happy birthday, my darling.

        Itâ€™s been, whatâ€”three years now since weâ€™ve known each other?
        Thatâ€™s three whole years of me loving you in every damn way.

        Youâ€™re incredible, babygirl. Truly. I donâ€™t say it lightly when I say I love you so fucking much. Youâ€™re one of the best things to ever happen in my life, and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d do without you.

        I hope today is amazing â€” like, actually amazing. I hope you laugh too much, smile until your cheeks hurt, and get reminded just how special you are to everyone around you.

        And I hope this website makes you happy â€” because believe me, I had a scrap version before and it annoyed the hell out of me. This one? This oneâ€™s made with real love. All of it, just for you.

        Love you always,
        Me.
